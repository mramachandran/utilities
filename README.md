# Utilies
This is for python utilities that could be used for creating table in SQL server based on headers contained in csv files. 

#Background
The need for this utility started with using Qlik sense where you cannot export the data model. We then used Qlik scripts to generate files for each table in csv format and then use this utility to create tables based on csv.

#Docuementation
We can then use Redgate's SQL Doc utility to generate documentation on this physical instance of the data model.
